    <h2>
      PROLOGUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      [<i>A Being, clad in Grey, is speaking. He is speaking of the Life of Man.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The stage presents the semblance of a large, square, empty room which
      has neither doors nor windows, and within which all is uniformly grey and
      misty. The ceiling, walls, and floor are grey, and from some hidden source
      there flows a stream of dim, unflickering light, of the same dull,
      monotonous, elusive colour. This light throws no shadows, nor is reflected
      back from any point.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Without a sound the Being in Grey detaches himself from the wall, with
      which he has almost seemed to mingle. He is clothed in a loose, grey,
      shapeless habit, roughly outlining a gigantic frame, and his head is
      veiled in a cowl of the all-pervading hue. This cowl throws the upper
      portion of his face into deep shadow, so that no eyes, but only a nose,
      mouth, and prominent chin are visible; all of which features are as
      clear-cut in outline and granite-like in texture as though they were hewn
      of grey stone. At first his lips are tightly compressed; until presently
      he raises his head a little, and begins to speak in a stern, Cold voice&mdash;a
      voice as destitute of passion or emotion as that of some hired clerk
      reading aloud, with dry nonchalance, the records of a court of law.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Look ye and listen, ye who have come hither for sport and laughter; for
      there is about to pass before you, from its mysterious beginning to its
      mysterious close, the whole life of a Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto without being; hidden away in the womb of eternity; possessed
      neither of thought nor feeling; remote from the range of human ken,&mdash;the
      Man bursts, in some unknown manner, the bars of non-existence, and
      announces with a cry the beginning of his brief life. In the night of
      non-existence there bursts forth also a little candle, lit by an unseen
      hand. It is the life of that Man. Mark well its flame: for it is the life
      of that Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born, the Man assumes the name and image of humanity, and becomes in all
      things like unto other men who dwell upon the earth. Their hard lot
      becomes his, and his, in turn, becomes the lot of all who shall come after
      him. Drawn on inexorably by time, it is not given him to see the next rung
      on which his faltering foot shall fall. Bounded in knowledge, it is not
      given him to foretell what each succeeding hour, what each succeeding
      minute, shall have in store for him. In blind nescience, in an agony of
      foreboding, in a whirl of hopes and fears, he completes the sorry cycle of
      an iron destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we see him a joyous youth. Mark how clearly the candle burns! Icy
      winds from! desert wastes may eddy round it and pass by. Its flame may
      flicker gently, but it still remains quite bright and clear. Yet the wax
      is ever melting as the flame consumes it&mdash;yet the wax is ever
      melting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we see him a happy man and father. Mark how dim, how strange, is now
      the candle's glimmer! Its flame is growing pale and wrinkled, it shivers
      as with cold, and its light is feebler than of yore. For the wax is ever
      melting as the flame consumes it&mdash;for the wax is ever melting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly we see him an old man, weak and ailing. The rungs of the ladder
      have all been climbed, and only a black abyss yawns before his faltering
      foot. The flame of the candle is drooping earthward, and turning to a
      faint blue. It droops and quivers, it droops and quivers&mdash;and then
      softly goes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Man dies. Come from darkness, into darkness he returns, and is
      reabsorbed, without a trace left, into the illimitable void of time. There
      there is neither thought not feeling, nor any intercourse with men. And I,
      the Unknown, shall remain ever the fellow-traveller of that Man&mdash;through
      all the days of his life, through all his journeyings. Though unseen by
      him and his companions, I shall ever be by his side. Be he waking or
      sleeping, be he praying or blaspheming; in the hour of joy, when his soul
      soars free and fearless; in the hour of sorrow, when his spirit is
      o'ershadowed by the languor of death, and the blood is curdling back upon
      his heart; in the hour of victory or defeat as he wages his great contest
      with the Inevitable,&mdash;I shall be with him, I shall ever be with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And ye who have come hither for sport and laughter (ye who none the less
      must die also), look ye and listen: for there is about to pass before you,
      and to reveal to you its joys and its sorrows, the brief, fleeting life of
      a Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Once more the Being in Grey is silent; and as his voice ceases, the
      light becomes wholly extinguished, and his form and the grey, empty room
      are swallowed up in impenetrable darkness</i>. ]

      ACT I&mdash;THE BIRTH OF THE MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      [<i>The stage is in deep shadow&mdash;nothing being visible amid the gloom
      save the silhouetted grey forms of some old, women and the faint outlines
      of a large and lofty chamber. Clad in weird, shapeless garments, the old
      women look, as they crouch together, like a little cluster of grey mice.
      They are talking in low tones.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>Dialogue of the Old Women.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I knew which her baby is going to be&mdash;a boy or a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever can it matter to <i>you?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing; except that I prefer boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>I</i> prefer girls. They sit quietly at home, and make company when
      one wants a gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, you are so fond of company!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Old Women give a chuckle.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman herself is hoping it will be a girl, for she says that boys are
      too boisterous and headstrong, and too fond of running into danger. While
      they are little (she says) they are for ever climbing tall trees and
      bathing in deep water; and when they are grown up they take to. fighting,
      and killing one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pooh! Does she think that <i>girls</i> never get drowned? Many a drowned
      girl's corpse have I seen, and they looked as all drowned corpses do&mdash;wet
      and livid and swollen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And does she think that gauds and jewellery never yet brought a girl to
      her death?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, poor thing! she is having a hard and painful childbed of it. Here have
      we been sitting these sixteen mortal hours, and she screaming the whole
      time! True, she is quieter now, and only gasps and moans, but, a short
      while ago, it fairly split one's ears to hear her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor thinks she is going to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no! What the doctor said was that the <i>child</i> will be born dead,
      but the mother herself recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why need there be births at all? They are such painful things!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, why need there be deaths either? They are more painful still, are
      they not?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Old Women chuckle again.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah well, 'tis the way of the world&mdash;births and deaths, births and
      deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; and then more births.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>For the third time the Old Women chuckle. At the same moment there is
      heard behind the scenes a stifled cry, as of a woman in agony.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      There! She is going to scream again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, at least it is a good sign that she has recovered her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is a good sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      That poor husband of hers! The silly fool is in such a way about it that
      it makes one almost die of laughing to see him. A short while ago he was
      in raptures because his wife was pregnant, and kept saying that he hoped
      the baby would be a boy. Perhaps he thought that any boy of <i>his</i>
      would grow up to be a Minister of State or a general at the very least!
      But now he wants neither boy nor girl, but only fusses about and weeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the pangs come upon her he seems to suffer almost as much as she
      does. He grows absolutely livid in the face!
    </p>
    <p>
      A short while ago they sent him to the chemist's for some medicine; but,
      after kicking his heels about outside the shop for two mortal hours, he
      was still unable to remember what he had come for, and had to go home
      again empty-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Old Women burst into renewed chuckles, while the screams behind
      the scenes increase for a moment, and then die away again into silence.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      What ails her now? Surely she has not expired?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not she! Had that been so, we should have heard the waiters beginning
      their lament, and the doctor running about the house, and chattering his
      foolish nonsense. Besides, her husband would have been gone off into a
      dead faint and been brought in here, and then <i>we</i> should have had
      some work to do. No, no; she's not dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why need we stay here longer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, ask <i>Him</i>. How can <i>we</i> tell what is going to happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      He never tells us <i>anything</i>&mdash;never!
    </p>
    <p>
      No, indeed! He is a perfect pest to us&mdash;for ever pulling us out of
      our beds, and setting us to watch, and then telling us that we need not
      have come after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, since we <i>are</i> here, we may as well do something.
      There! She is screaming again! Anyway, we could not help coming, could we?
    </p>
    <p>
      No; he gave us no choice in the matter. Yet surely you have had enough
      watching by now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I just sit quiet and wait&mdash;sit quiet and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a patient old lady you are, to be sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Old Women chuckle again, and the screams grow louder.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreadful those screams sound! What agony she must be in! Do you know
      what that agony is like? It is like having one's entrails torn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, we have all been through it in our time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but I doubt whether <i>she</i> has before. Listen to that voice of
      hers! One would hardly know it to be hers at all. It used to be such a
      sweet and gentle one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, 'tis more like the howl of a wild beast now. Besides, it has a sort
      of a night sound in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. It puts me in mind of great, dark, lonely forests, and of utter
      solitude and desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; and of despair and a broken heart. But is there no one in the room
      with her? Why is it we hear no voices but hers&mdash;no voices but that
      terrible, yelling, shrieking voice of hers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, there are people in the room with her, only we do not seem to remark
      their voices when she is screaming. Have you never noticed that a scream
      always appears to stand out from other sounds? No matter how many persons
      there be talking and chattering together, let but a scream be uttered, and
      the whole world seems to be struck silent and listening to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, once I heard a man cry out as he was being run over by a wagon. The
      street was full of people at the time, yet at the moment he might have
      been the only one in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is a stranger sound than any <i>man</i> could utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is a trifle more <i>shrill</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, it is more prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you are right. It is a stranger sound than any man could utter.
      Besides, it has the ring of death in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well? Was there not a ring of death in that man's cry as well? He died,
      didn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes; but never mind. We need not quarrel about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>For a moment there is silence. Then the screams begin again.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      What a strange thing is a scream! If it is you yourself who are screaming
      you never notice how horrible the screams sound: but if it is some one
      else&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What throat can possibly produce such a noise as she is making? Surely it
      cannot be a woman's throat? No, no; I cannot believe it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cries sound as though her neck were being twisted round and round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or as though the cries were coming from some deep hollow in her chest. Now
      they are more like the gasps of a drowning man. Listen to the choking
      noise she is making!
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounds as though some heavy person were kneeling on her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or as though she were being strangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The screams suddenly cease.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      There! At last she is quiet again. I was getting tired of it all. It was
      such a monotonous, ugly screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you expect to find it <i>beautiful</i>, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Old Women chuckle.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush! Is <i>He</i> here?
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe He is.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not approve of laughter.
    </p>

      Yes, and spoilt too.
    </p>
    <p>
      And troublesome as well. I cannot abide them. As soon as ever they are
      born they begin to cry out, and to beg for what they want, just as though
      everything ought to be ready to their hand at once. Even before they can
      see out of their eyes they have learnt that there are such things in the
      world as a breast and milk, and straightway they ask for them. Then they
      need to be put to bed, and to be rocked to sleep, and to have their little
      red backs patted. For my part, I like them best when they are dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they grow less clamorous&mdash;they just stretch themselves out, and
      require rocking to sleep no more.

      just after they are born!

      And <i>I</i> to wash them just after they are dead!

      them after they, are born, and another to wash them after they are dead.
      That is all about it.

      she never uttered a sound from start to finish.

      and take a saner, cooler view of things.

    <p>
      I am afraid he will bring much indulgence and absurdity to bear upon the
      education of this child.

      Yes. He is a man much too easily influenced. Though anything but rich, he
      gives away money to the most undeserving people.

      In my opinion a small, but warm, flat is preferable to a large, but cold,

      ACT II&mdash;LOVE AND POVERTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      [<i>The stage is in clear light, while the scene represents a large, lofty
      room with bare walls of a bright pink colour that is intersected, in
      places, with grey tracery fantastically designed. To the right are two
      curtainless casement windows through which the outer night shows darkly,
      while the furniture consists of a couple of bedsteads, two chairs, and a
      rough deal table, on the latter of which stands a broken water-jug,
      holding a bunch of wild flowers. In one corner (which is in deeper shadow
      than the rest of the apartment) stands the Being in Grey. The candle in
      his hand is burnt away for a third of its length, yet its flame remains
      steady, bright, and tall, and throws the statuesque face of the Being into
      strong relief.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Enter a group of Neighbours, dressed in holiday attire, and carrying
      in their hands flowers, wild grasses, and sprigs of oak and birch. They
      disperse themselves about the room, looking cheerful, kindly, simple, and
      solicitous as they do so.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>Dialogue of the Neighbours.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      How poor they must be! See, they have not even a spare chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor curtains to the windows!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor pictures on the walls!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor a morsel in their larder except some stale bread!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor anything to drink but water&mdash;cold water from the well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor sufficient clothes to wear! For she is always to be seen in the same
      worn-out pink dress and frayed hair-riband&mdash;things only fit for a
      servant-girl to wear, and <i>he</i> is never to be seen in anything but an
      artist's blouse with turned-down collar&mdash;a garment which makes him
      look like a tramp, and sets all the dogs barking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so much so that respectable people are afraid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dogs never like poor people. Yesterday I saw no fewer than three dogs
      flying at him at once; yet he only cried, as he beat them off with his
      stick: "Do not you dare to tear my trousers! They are the only ones I have
      left!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time he was laughing, though the dogs were showing their teeth at
      him, and growling most furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      And only to-day I saw a smart lady and gentleman so nervous at his
      appearance that they crossed to the other side of the road to avoid
      passing him. "I think he is going to beg of us," the gentleman said, and
      the lady exclaimed shrilly that probably he would assault them as well. So
      they crossed over&mdash;eyeing him carefully as they did so, and keeping a
      tight hold upon their pockets. But he only tossed his head and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he is always in good spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them are like that&mdash;always merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and singing too; or, rather, he sings, and she dances to his singing,
      in that poor pink dress of hers and shabby riband!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite a pleasure to look at them, they are so youthful and handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, I feel very, very sorry for them. At times they are almost
      starving. To think of it!&mdash;starving!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, too true. Once upon a time they had plenty of furniture and clothes;
      but, little by little, they have had to sell them, until now they have
      nothing at all left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I remember the time when she used to wear beautiful serge dresses;
      but now those dresses have had to go for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he used to wear a fine frockcoat&mdash;the one in which he got
      married; but that too has had to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the only valuables they have left to them are their
      wedding-rings. What poverty, to be sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, they do not care, they do not care! I too have been young, and know
      how one takes things at that age.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you say, Grandfather?
    </p>
    <p>
      I say that they do not care, they do not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      See, it almost makes Grandfather sing, even to think of them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and dance too!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>There is general laughter.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      And her husband is <i>so</i> kindhearted! One day he made my little boy a
      bow-and-arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when my little girl fell ill his wife wept almost as much as I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when my garden wall fell down he helped me to build it up in no time.
      What a fine strong fellow he is, to be sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is quite pleasant to have such kindly folks for neighbours. Their
      youthfulness helps to warm our chilly old age, and their lightheartedness
      to drive away our care.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this poor room of theirs looks like a prison-cell, it is so bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay. Say, rather, it is like a church, it is so bright!
    </p>
    <p>
      See the flowers on the table! She ha's been plucking them as she walked
      through the fields, in that poor pink gown of hers and faded hair-riband.
      Here are some May lilies, with the dew not dry upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a bright red pineflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      And violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      And field grasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not touch them, dear children&mdash;do not touch the flowers. She has
      imprinted her kiss upon them, so we must not let them fall to the ground.
      She has breathed her sweet breath upon them, so we must not mingle our
      breath with hers. Do not touch them, dear children&mdash;do not touch
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She means him to see them the moment he enters the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and to receive her sweet kisses from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to scent her dear breath in theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come! We must go now, we must go now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But surely we did not come here to leave nothing behind us for these
      charming young neighbours of ours? That would be a sorry thing to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have brought a loaf of spiced bread and a bottle of milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I some sweet, fresh herbs. If we strew; the floor with them it will
      look like a verdant meadow, and smell of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I some flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we some sprigs of oak and birch, with their pretty green leaves. If we
      deck the walls with them the room will look like a fresh, luxuriant
      arbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my present is a fine cigar. It did not cost very much, but it is
      mellow and strong, and will be a splendid thing to dream over.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have brought her a new pink hair-riband. When she has bound up her
      hair with it she will look so neat and charming! It was given me by my
      sweetheart, but <i>I</i> have many ribands, whereas she has only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what have <i>you</i> brought with you, little girl? Surely you have
      brought some present for our good neighbours?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, nothing&mdash;nothing. At least, I have brought my cough with me, but
      they would not care for <i>that</i>, would they, neighbour?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, little girl; no more than they would for my crutches. Ah, dear
      child, who would care for crutches?
    </p>
    <p>
      But you leave good wishes behind you, Grandfather, do you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, my dear. And so, I know, do you. Now we must go, good
      neighbours, for it is getting late.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Neighbours begin to leave the room&mdash;some of them yawning as
      they go, the little girl coughing badly, and the old man stumping along on
      crutches.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we must go now, we must go now.
    </p>
    <p>
      God grant them the best of good fortune, for they are such a kindly
      couple!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, God grant them always good health and happiness and mutual love: and
      may He see to it that never a black cat step between them, to bring them
      evil luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      And may the poor young man find work to do; for it goes hard with a man
      when he cannot find work to earn his daily bread!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Exeunt all.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Enter the Man's Wife, her hair decked with wild flowers, and her whole
      appearance graceful, pretty, and innocent. At the same time, her face is
      expressive of deep dejection, and as she sits down to the table she turns
      towards the audience, and says in a sorrowful voice:</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just returned from the town, where I have been looking for, I have
      been looking for&mdash;oh, I hardly know <i>what</i> I have been looking
      for. We are so poor that we have nothing in all the world. Indeed, we find
      it a struggle even to live. We need money, money; yet I know not where to
      get it. If I were to go out into the streets and beg I feel sure that no
      one would give me anything. No, every one would refuse me. And, moreover,
      I have not the courage to do it. I have tried hard to get work for my
      husband, but it is not to be got. Every one to whom I apply says that
      there is too little work to do, and too many people to do it. I have even
      roamed the town, and searched the roadways, in the hope that some rich
      lady or gentleman might have dropped a purse or jewellery; but either no
      one had done so, or else some mortal, luckier than I, had found the
      treasure first. Oh, I am so unhappy! Soon my husband will be coming home&mdash;tired
      out with his long search for work to do; yet once more he will find that I
      have nothing for him but my poor kisses! And kisses will not feed a
      starving man. Oh, I am so unhappy that I could weep for ever! To me it is
      nothing to have to go hungry&mdash;indeed, I scarcely feel it; but he is
      different, for he has a larger frame to feed, and requires more food. When
      he has had to go hungry a little while he begins to look so white and ill,
      so thin and worried! He takes to scolding me, and then gives me a kiss,
      and begs me not to mind what he has said. But <i>I</i> never mind; I love
      him too much for that. Oh, I am so unhappy! He is one of the cleverest
      architects in all the world. Indeed, I believe he is a veritable genius.
      Left, when quite an infant, to face the world alone, he was adopted by
      some relations. But, alas! his quick and independent temper led him to say
      things which displeased them, and caused them to declare that he was
      ungrateful; with the result that, in the end, they turned him from their
      doors again. Yet still he continued his studies&mdash;maintaining himself
      the while by giving lessons, and often going hungry. Yes, he came well to
      know what hunger meant! Yet now, though he has completed his course of
      studies, and become a fully qualified architect, and can do the most
      beautiful designs imaginable, no one will accept them. Nay, some stupid
      people even laugh at them! To succeed in life one needs two things&mdash;influence
      and a lucky star: and he has neither. So he goes wandering about, ever
      looking for a chance&mdash;any sort of a chance&mdash;to find work to do.
      It may even be that, like myself, he searches the roadways for lost
      purses, for he is but a boy in mind as well as in years. Of course, <i>some</i>
      day we shall succeed: but the question is, When will that be? Meanwhile
      life is very hard for us; for although, when we married, we had a little
      money, it soon disappeared, what with too many visits to the theatre and
      too much eating of bonbons. <i>He</i> is still sanguine of success, but I&mdash;well,
      sometimes I seem to lose all hope, and give way to tears when quite alone.
      Even now my heart is aching to think that here is he coming home&mdash;only
      to find nothing for him but my poor kisses!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>She rises from her chair, and goes down upon her knees.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      O Lord God, be unto us a kind and pitying Father. Thou hast so much to
      give of what we need&mdash;of bread, of work, of money. Thy earth is so
      rich, it brings forth so much fruit and corn in its fields&mdash;it covers
      its meadows with so many flowers, it yields such weight of gold, such
      countless shining gems from the depths of its dark bowels! Thy sun's rays
      have so much warmth in them; in the shining of Thy stars there is so much
      pensive and peaceful joy! Give us, then, but a little of that bounty&mdash;but
      a little, but so much as Thou bestowest upon Thy birds: a little bread to
      stay the hunger of my brave, beloved husband, a little warmth to fend him
      from the cold, a little work to do, that he may raise his handsome head
      once more. And, I beseech Thee, be not angry with him that he should scold
      me so often, and that at other times he should laugh and bid me dance: for
      he is as yet but young, and cannot always be grave and sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>She rises to her feet again.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      There! Now that I have said a prayer I feel better&mdash;I begin to hope
      once more. Surely God must give <i>occasionally</i> when He is entreated
      so often? Now I will go out again and search the roadways, in the hope
      that some one may have dropped a purse or some jewellery.

      The woman knows not that her prayer is already granted. She knows not that
      this very day some noblemen have been bending eagerly over some designs
      submitted by the Man, and that finally they have decided to accept them.
      All this day those two noblemen have been seeking the Man in vain. Yea,
      wealth has been seeking him, even as hitherto he has been seeking wealth.
      And early on the morrow, at the hour when workmen are setting forth to
      their toil, a carriage will draw up at the entrance to the Man's dwelling,
      and the two wealthy noblemen will enter his humble chamber&mdash;bowing
      low in courteous salutation as they do so, and bringing with them the
      first beginnings of his fame and fortune. But, as yet, neither the Man nor
      his Wife knows of this, although good fortune is coming to the Man as
      surely as some day it will depart again.

      [<i>Enter the Man and his Wife. The former has a proud, handsome head,
      brilliant eyes, a high forehead, and dark eyebrows&mdash;the latter
      springing from a point so low down the nose as almost to resemble a pair
      of small, clearly defined wings attached to that member. His wavy black
      hair is flung back clear of his brow, and there are visible, over a soft,
      white turned-down collar, a well-set neck and a portion of the throat.
      Although his movements are as quick and elastic as those of some young
      animal, his pose is purely that of a symmetrical, well-balanced human
      being.</i>]

    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more nothing! Soon I shall have to take to lying in bed all day: so
      that whoever wants to see me will have to come to <i>me</i>, not I go to
      <i>him</i>. Yes, I will begin that mode of life to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you so tired, then, my darling?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, tired and hungry; and though I could devour a whole ox, like one of
      Homer's heroes, I suppose I shall have to put up with a piece of dry
      bread! Yet a man cannot go on eating dry bread for ever, when all the time
      his appetite craves to be sated&mdash;craves for something into which it
      can plunge its teeth, and gorge itself, and be filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so sorry for you, my dearest one!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As I am for you. Yet that makes me none the less ravenous. To-day I spent
      a whole hour in front of a cookshop; and just as people gape at
      masterpieces of art, so did I gape at the fat pies and capons and sausages
      in the window. And oh, the signboard above them! Do you know, it is
      possible to depict a ham on a signboard so cunningly that one could devour
      it, signboard and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;I too could eat something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course. Who could not? But do you like lobsters?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I simply adore them!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what a lobster I saw there! Though only a painted one, he was fairer
      even than the reality. Red, stately, and severe as a cardinal, he looked
      fit for consecration. I believe I could eat <i>two</i> such cardinals, and
      a reverend father carp into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>

    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive me, forgive me, but I am so hungry! See how my hand is trembling.
      I could not even throw a stone at a dog with it.

      But what is this parcel on the table? It seems to send forth a most
      unctuous smell. Did you put it there?

    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No indeed! It must have been the neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      What dear, goodhearted folks! But it is strange to think that, for all the
      kind people in the world, a man may perish of hunger! Why should that be?&mdash;Ah!
      Look there!

    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      How you frighten me! How your eyes are staring! What is it you see? Surely
      it is something dreadful?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Even as I jested there uprose before me&mdash;there, in that dark
      corner&mdash;the terrible figure of Starvation! Do you not see it now? Its
      hands are stretched forth as in piteous appeal, like those of some poor
      child which is lost in a forest and keeps crying out in a voice of
      childish agony&mdash;a voice which echoes and re-echoes in the deserted
      wilds&mdash;"Help me, or I die! Help me, or I die!"&mdash;and there is
      none to hear! Look, my wife, look! See how those dark shadows quiver and
      float, like volumes of black smoke belched forth from some deep shaft
      leading down to the pit of hell! See! see! I am being drawn into them!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I am terrified! I dare not look into that corner!&mdash;But, nay, nay;
      'twas only in the street you saw all this?

    </p>
    <p>
      No, no! God would never permit it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But why not? Does He not permit it to happen to <i>other</i> people?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; but we are better than they. We are <i>good</i> people, and have done
      no wrong.

      But you have never <i>really</i> been cruel to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I have!&mdash;yes, many and many a time! Nor is that all; for no wild
      boar could fall to grinding his tusks more wickedly than I do as I wander
      through the streets and gaze upon all those things whereof we stand in
      such desperate need. Ah, how much money there is in the world that we have
      not got! Listen to me, little wife. This afternoon I was walking in the
      park&mdash;that beautiful park where the paths run straight as
      pistol-shots, and the beech-trees look like kings in crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And I too was walking in the streets, with shops, shops, shops everywhere&mdash;such
      beautiful shops!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And people passed me who were carrying gold-mounted canes and wearing
      splendid clothes: and I could not help thinking to myself, "Ah, <i>I</i>
      have none of these things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And I too was passed by rich people&mdash;by fine ladies in dainty boots
      which made their feet look so elegant, and exquisite hats from under which
      their eyes glanced so bewitchingly, and silken petticoats which gave their
      figures such an inexpressible charm: and I could not help thinking to
      myself, "Ah, <i>I</i> have no smart hats and silken petticoats!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One dandy had the impudence to jostle me, but I just gave him a glimpse of
      my boar's tusks, and he very soon lost himself in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And I too was jostled by a fine lady; yet I could not bring myself even to
      look at her, I felt so miserable!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I saw people riding in the park&mdash;riding fiery, spirited horses.
      Alas, <i>I</i> have none such!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine lady whom I met was wearing diamond earrings&mdash;earrings which
      I could actually have kissed!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Red and green motor-cars, with great, glaring eyes, were gliding along as
      silently as ghosts, and the people in them were laughing and jesting and
      looking indolently about them. Alas, <i>I</i> have no motor-car!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor I diamonds, nor emeralds, nor clear white pearls!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Up above the ornamental water there was a restaurant, blazing with lights
      like the firmament of heaven; and in it people were dining, while men in
      tail-coats who might have been ministers of State, and white-aproned women
      who looked like veritable winged angels, were carrying wine and dishes
      about. And every one was eating and drinking, eating and drinking. Ah, how
      I too could have eaten and drunk! My wife, my wife, I am so hungry!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      My poor darling, it is having to walk about so much that makes you hungry.
      But never mind. Sit down here, and I will climb on to your knee, and you
      shall take paper and pencil and draw me a beautiful, beautiful palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but my inspiration seems equally to be suffering from hunger; it
      cannot rise above pictures of eatables, and for a long while past I have
      been making my palaces look like pies filled with rich stuffing and my
      churches like pease-puddings. But I see tears in your eyes! What ails
      thee, little wife of mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It hurts me so much to think that I can do nothing for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is that it? Then am I filled with shame to think that I&mdash;I, a strong
      man, talented, educated, and in the prime of life&mdash;should sit here
      grumbling until I have seen my poor little wife&mdash;the good fairy of
      the legends&mdash;burst into tears! When a woman weeps it is a man's
      shame. I am overcome with remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not <i>your</i> fault that people do not appreciate you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless I blush to my ears. I feel that I deserve as sound a whipping
      as ever I received when I was a boy. To think that you too were hungry&mdash;as
      hungry as I am&mdash;and that I never noticed it! Oh, what a selfish
      egoist am I! It was shameful of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest one, I was not, I am not, hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it was shameful and unmanly of me! The dandy who jostled me in the
      park did rightly, for he saw that it was a mere sensual pig that was
      passing him by&mdash;a wild boar of sharp tusks indeed, but most gross
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you go on scolding yourself so unjustly I shall weep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, you must not weep. When I see tears in those pretty eyes I am
      seized with dread. Yes, I am afraid of those little crystal drops; for,
      whenever I behold them, I feel as though it were not you, but some
      stranger whom I know not, that were shedding them. No, you must not weep.
      We are poor, and have nothing, I know, but we can talk of what we shall
      surely have <i>some</i> day, and I can tell you bright fairy tales, and
      wrap you round with shining fancies, my little queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, we have no cause to be afraid. You are too strong, and too great a
      genius, to be vanquished by life. The present time will pass away, and
      inspiration will once more spread its influence over your splendid head.

      Very well. I will go out and buy it myself&mdash;buy it in the

    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have no land yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, but I shall soon be buying some. I have always wished to possess an
      estate, not only as a pleasure-ground, but also as a place where I may
      build a house from my own designs. The rascally world shall see what an
      architect I am!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I should like the house to be in Italy, close to the sea: a villa of white
      marble, set in the midst of a grove of lime-trees and cypresses, with
      white marble steps leading down to the blue waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I see your idea. It would be capital. Yet <i>my</i> plan, rather, is
      to build a castle on a Norwegian mountain, with a fjord below, and the
      castle parched on a peak above. Have we no paper? Well, never mind. I can
      show you on the wall what I mean. This is the fjord. Do you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. How beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And here are the deep, sparkling waters, reflecting the tender green of
      the grass above. Here, too, is a red, black, and cinnamon-coloured cliff.
      And there, in that gap (just where I have made that smudge), is a patch of
      blue sky, gleaming through a fleecy white cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, it is not a cloud. Rather, it is a white boat, with its reflection in
      the water, like two white swans joined breast to breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And see, over all there rises a mountain, with sides of brilliant green,
      except just at the top, where it is more misty and rugged. Here, too, are
      sharp spurs, and dark shadows of clefts, and wisps of cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it looks like a ruined castle!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>here</i>&mdash;on that "ruined castle," as you call it (just where
      I have put that mark in the centre)&mdash;I will build me a stately
      mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But it will be so cold up there&mdash;so windy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, I shall give the mansion stout walls and huge windows of plate-glass;
      and then at night, when the winter storms are raging and the fjord is
      tossing below, we shall draw the curtains over the windows, and heap up a
      roaring fire (I shall make enormous fireplaces, you know&mdash;large
      enough to hold whole trunks of trees, whole beams of pine).
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! it will be warm enough <i>then</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed; and the whole interior will be quiet and restful, for I mean
      to have soft carpets everywhere, and the walls lined with thousands and
      thousands of books, and everything looking snug and cheerful. And you and
      I will sit before the fire on a white bearskin; and when you say to me,
      "Shall we go and look at the storm?" I shall answer, "Yes," and we shall
      run to the largest of the great windows, and draw aside the curtains: and
      then, my God, what a night it will look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Snowflakes whirling by!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; like little white horses galloping, or myriads of tiny, frightened
      souls, pale with fear and seeking shelter in the night. And there will be
      such a howling and a roaring!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And I shall say that I am cold, and give a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And then we shall scamper back to the fire, and I shall call aloud, "Ho,
      there! Bring me the ancestral goblet&mdash;the one of pure gold from which
      Vikings have drunk&mdash;and fill it with aureate wine, and let us drain
      the soul-warming draught to the dregs!" Meanwhile we shall have had a
      chamois roasting on the spit, and again I shall call aloud, "Ho, there!
      Bring hither the venison, that we may eat it!" Yes, and in about two
      seconds I shall be eating <i>you</i>, little wife, for I am as hungry as
      the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      What next? Well, once I have begun to eat it, there will soon be little of
      it left&mdash;and therefore nothing more to tell. But what are you doing
      to my head, little playmate?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

      I am the Goddess of Fame. I have woven you a chaplet of the oak-leaves
      which the neighbours brought, and am crowning you with it. Thus shall fame&mdash;yes,

    <p>
      Yes. And see how people are bowing down to us, and whispering about us,
      and pointing us out with their fingers. Here is a city father shedding
      tears of joy as he exclaims, "Happy is our town to have been the
      birthplace of such children!" Here, too, a certain young man turns pale
      with emotion as he gazes upon his handiwork; for fortune has smiled upon
      him at last, and he has built a City Hall that is the pride of all the
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, even as you are <i>my</i> pride. And even as I have placed this
      wreath of oak-leaves upon your head, so will the day come when you are
      accorded one of laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But look again. Here are other magnates of my native town advancing to pay

    <p>
      And a cigar! Cigars do not grow on windowsills. They cost money, and have
      to be bought in shops. What you see is only a piece of black twig, or
      something of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But look for yourself. I am sure it must be the neighbours who have left
      these things for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbours? Well, of a truth they may have been the instruments, but
      the work has been the work of God himself. And even if it were devils who
      have brought the things here, it should not prevent you from coming and
      sitting on my knee, little wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Man's Wife seats herself upon his knee, and they proceed to eat;
      she breaking off little bits of bread, and placing them between his lips,
      while he feeds her with milk out of the bottle.</i>]

    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe it is cream, it looks so good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it is milk. You must bite your bread more carefully, or you will
      choke.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, I shall not. Let me have some more of the crust&mdash;of that nice
      brown crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am <i>sure</i> you will choke before you have finished.

    <p>
      No, no. See how easily I swallow.

    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then let me lick it up. Not a drop of it ought to be wasted.

      Be ready. Now, then! Quick!&mdash;Ah, everything good comes to an end too
      soon. I believe that this bottle must have got a false bottom to it, to
      make it look deeper. What rascally fellows those bottlemakers are!

      your pretty little neck.

      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>

    <p>

    <p>
      There! I have asserted my rights. And now, little wifie, you must dance.
      Imagine this to be a splendid, a supernaturally beautiful palace.
    </p>
    <p>

      I am ready.

      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And that counts, marquises, and city magnates keep requesting the honour
      of your hand, but you persistently refuse them, and choose, instead, a man
      like&mdash;like&mdash;oh, a man in a beautiful gala dress, a real live
      prince. What did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>His Wife.</b>
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /><b>The Man.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, then. Imagine such a man to have asked you to dance with him
      (for I suppose you would not care to have the empty air for a partner,
      would you?).

      Good! Imagine, too, A marvellous orchestra, with a Turkish drum beating
      pom, pom, pom.

      What a fool I am! Very well, then. Never mind that part. Let us begin

    <h2>
      ACT III&mdash;THE BALL GIVEN BY THE MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      [<i>A grand ball is in progress in the salon of the mansion which the Man
      has built for himself. The scene is a large, square, lofty room with
      smooth, white walls and ceiling and a polished floor. Yet a certain
      discrepancy in the proportions of some of the minor features of the
      apartment conveys to the beholder a sort of vague, unsatisfactory
      impression, as though something were wanting, or discordant, or
      superfluous, or bizarre&mdash;one cannot exactly tell which. For instance,
      the doors are small as compared with the windows, and constitute, with the
      latter, the only features breaking the monotony of the apartment's
      outline. The windows, too, are of immense size. Reaching almost to the
      ceiling, they are placed only in the rear wall, and in close juxtaposition
      to one another, while their panes show black with the darkness of the
      outer night, and neither spot nor speck breaks the wall spaces between
      them. Eloquent testimony to the wealth of the Man is afforded by the
      superabundance of gilding on the cornices, chairs, and picture-frames; yet
      the pictures are but few in number, and confined to the side walls, of
      which they form the sole adornment. Light is furnished by hoop-shaped
      lustres and a few scattered electric globes. Nevertheless, though the
      ceiling is in brilliant relief, the rest of the room is in slight shadow&mdash;a
      circumstance which imparts a kind of greyish tinge to the walls. In
      general, the scene has about it an air of pallor and chill.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The ball is in full swing&mdash;the music being furnished by an
      orchestra of three players, each of whom bears a certain resemblance to
      his instrument. The fiddler has a long, thin neck and a small head
      ornamented on both sides with little tufts of hair. His body is
      grotesquely curved in outline, and he has a handkerchief neatly folded on
      his shoulder, to form a pad for his fiddle. The flute player resembles his
      flute in that he is exceedingly tall and thin, with long, lean face and
      taper legs; while the man with the double-bass is short, with broad,
      rounded shoulders, a fat body, and baggy trousers. All three executants
      play with an energy which is manifested even in their faces as they grind
      out the tune and sway their heads and bodies to and fro to the rhythm. The
      tune in question (which is never once changed throughout the ball)
      consists of a short, polka-like air, made up of two separate parts, and
      charged with a sort of vapid, jaunty, staccato lilt. All the instruments
      are slightly out of tune with one another, and this sometimes causes the
      discrepancies in pitch and tempo to give rise to an extraordinary series
      of dissonances and gaps in the melody. The following is the tune:&mdash;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:65%">
      <img src="images/0080.jpg" alt="0080" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0080.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>

    <p>
      <i>To these strains a number of young men and girls are dancing a legato
      measure in a graceful, refined manner. To the first phrase of the tune
      they advance and meet; to the second phrase they retire; to the third and
      fourth they advance and retire as before&mdash;all with a rather stately,
      old-fashioned demeanour.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Along the walls are seated a number of chaperons and other guests, in
      a variety of studiedly affected attitudes. Their movements are stiff and
      angular, and their remarks stilted and spasmodic. Never is the correctness
      of their tone lowered by, for instance, light laughter or whispering.
      Gazing straight in front of them, with their hands primly folded on their
      laps and their wrists stuck out so sharply as to convey the impression
      that those members have been fractured, these onlookers mouth their
      sentences in the sententious fashion of copybooks, and express, in their
      whole bearing, a sort of disdainful weariness. Indeed, so absolutely
      monotonous and uniform in expression are their fades that the latter would
      seem to have been turned out of one and the same mould&mdash;a mould which
      has stamped them with a stereotyped air of conceit and arrogance, coupled
      with a certain dull respect for the Man's wealth. The dancers are dressed
      in white, the musicians in black, and the remaining guests in white,
      black, or yellow. In the right-hand front corner of the stage (a corner in
      deeper shadow than the rest of the scene') stands the motionless figure of
      the Being in Grey. The candle in his hand is now burnt away for two-thirds
      of its length, yet its flame is still strong and yellow, and continues to
      throw lurid gleams over the statuesque face and chin of the Being.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>Dialogue of the Guests.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel it my bounden duty to remark that to be numbered among the guests
      at any ball given by the Man is indeed an honour!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; and to that you might have added that only a very limited circle of
      persons are permitted to attain to that honour. My husband, my sons, my
      daughters, and myself are profoundly sensible of the privilege which has
      been accorded us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am truly sorry for those who have not had the good fortune to receive an
      invitation to the ball. Never this night, I fear, will they be able to
      close their eyes in sleep, by reason of the pangs of envy. Yet on the
      morrow they will not hesitate to speak in disparaging terms of the fÃªtes
      which the Man periodically gives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but never have they looked upon such brilliancy as we see here
      to-night!
    </p>
    <p>
      No, never! Nor, you might have added, upon such luxury and wealth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor upon such enchanting, such soul-emancipating gaiety! If this be not
      gaiety, then I know not what gaiety is. But let that pass. 'Tis ill
      quarrelling with persons who writhe in the pangs of envy. Yet I will
      venture to foretell that those same persons will presumptuously assert
      that these were not gilded chairs upon which we are now sitting&mdash;not
      gilded chairs!
    </p>
    <p>
      No; mere deteriorated articles, purchased, for a trifling sum, from some
      secondhand dealer!
    </p>
    <p>
      They will say, too, that those beautiful electric globes were tallow
      candles of the commonest quality!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;mere farthing dips!
    </p>
    <p>
      Or trashy oil lamps! Oh, tongues of envy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Peradventure they will have the effrontery to deny that the mansion has
      gilded cornices?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or that to the pictures on the walls there are the massive gilded frames
      which we see before us? For my part, I seem to hear the veritable chink of
      gold in this palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, at all events we behold its glitter: and that, in my opinion, is as
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seldom has it fallen to my lot to enjoy such ravishing strains as those
      which always greet our ears at balls given by the Man. They constitute the
      veritable music of the spheres, and waft the soul from earth to higher
      regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, in truth do they! Yet we have some reason to expect that the music
      should be of the finest quality, seeing that the Man is in a position to
      pay the immense fees demanded by the musicians. You must recollect that
      this is the most distinguished orchestra of the day, and plays at all the
      most <i>recherchÃ©</i> functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, one could listen to such strains for ever! They simply <i>enchant</i>
      one's sense of hearing! I may inform you that, for days and nights after
      one of these balls given by the Man, my sons and daughters never cease to
      hum the tunes which they have heard there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times I seem to hear such divine music when I am walking in the
      streets. I gaze around me, but neither instrument nor player is to be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>I</i> hear it in my dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      What appears to me so especially excellent about these musicians is that
      they play with such <i>abandon</i>. Though aware of the immense fees which
      they are entitled to demand for their services, they are yet good enough
      to refrain from giving nothing in return. That seems to me particularly
      right and proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. 'Tis as though the musicians completely-identified themselves with
      their instruments, so great is the verve with which they surrender
      themselves to their playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, rather, as though their instruments identified themselves with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      How rich it all is!
    </p>
    <p>
      Flow sumptuous!
    </p>
    <p>
      How brilliant!
    </p>
    <p>
      How luxurious!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>And so on, for a considerable time, like a pack of dogs barking one
      against the other.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have you to know that, in addition to this <i>salon</i>, the
      mansion contains no fewer than fifteen magnificent apartments. I have seen
      them all. The dining-room is fitted with a fireplace which can accommodate
      whole trunks of trees. The drawing-room, too, and boudoir are simply <i>gorgeous</i>,
      while the state bedroom is not only an apartment of the most gigantic
      dimensions, but is actually furnished with bedsteads to which baldaquins
      are attached!
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed? You surprise me! Baldaquins?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I said <i>baldaquins</i>. Pray permit me to continue what I was
      saying. The son of the house lives in a beautiful, bright nursery, lined
      throughout with yellow wood and gilding, so that the sun seems for ever to
      be shining there. And the little fellow is so charming! He has curls like
      the rays of the sun himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed! When one looks upon him one involuntarily exclaims, "The sun
      has just come out."
    </p>
    <p>
      And when one gazes into his eyes one involuntarily thinks, "Ah! Now are
      the chill autumn and winter passed, for there is blue sky to be seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Man loves the boy to distraction. He has just bought him a pony&mdash;a
      beautiful, pure white pony&mdash;to ride on. Now, <i>my</i> children&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, as we were saying. Have I yet told you of the bathroom?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, you have not.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a truly marvellous apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! Is it indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; with hot water always laid on. Then there is the Man's study, replete
      with books&mdash;endless books. He is said to be immensely clever&mdash;and
      of a truth you could tell that from the number of the books alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen the gardens. Have <i>you?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed? No, I have not.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I am not ashamed to confess that they simply astounded me. In them I
      saw the most marvellous lawns&mdash;all of an emerald green, and mown with
      surprising neatness, with little paths intersecting them, lined with the
      finest of red sand. And the flowers, too! And the palm-trees!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Palm-trees?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I said <i>palm-trees</i>. Every shrub is pruned into a shape of some
      kind, such as a pyramid or a column of green foliage. Then there is a
      fountain with huge globes of glass, and, in the centre of the main lawn, a
      number of plaster gnomes and sirens.
    </p>
    <p>
      How splendid!
    </p>
    <p>
      How brilliant!
    </p>
    <p>
      How luxurious!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>And so on, as before.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Man also did me the honour to show me his coach-houses and stables,
      until I found myself wholly unable to repress the admiration evoked in me
      by the spectacle of the horses and carriages which they contained. His
      motor-car, too, made a great impression upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, to think of it, he has no fewer than <i>seventeen</i> attendants for
      his person alone, in addition to the general staff of cooks,
      kitchen-maids, housemaids, gardeners, and so forth!
    </p>
    <p>
      And grooms, surely?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and grooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it is only right and proper that the Man and his Wife should
      have everything done for them, seeing that they are personages of such
      high degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; and for the same reason it is all the more an honour for us to be
      included among the number of their guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      But do you not find the music just a trifle&mdash;well, <i>monotonous?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I do not, and I am surprised that <i>you</i> should do so. Surely you
      know who the musicians are?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; I was but jesting. I could listen to such strains for ever. There is

      It is delightful to be able to surrender oneself to their influence, and
      to become absorbed in dreams of ecstatic bliss.

      [<i>And so on, as before.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      But I see a movement at that door. Probably the Man and his Wife are
      making their entry into the <i>salon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      See how the musicians are redoubling their efforts!
    </p>

      There they come! There they come!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there they come! There they come!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Man and his Wife appear at a low door on the right, accompanied by
      the Man's Friends and Enemies. They cross the salon obliquely to a door on
      the left, walking in solemn procession, and causing the dancers to divide
      and leave a clear space for them. The musicians play more loudly, and more
      extravagantly out of tune, than ever.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The Man looks much older than he did in Act II, and a sprinkling of
      grey is noticeable in his long hair and beard. Yet his face is still
      handsome and vigorous. He walks with a sort of calm dignity and aloofness,
      and gazes straight in front of him, as though he were not aware of the
      presence of the surrounding company. His Wife, too, looks older, but still
      beautiful, as she leans upon his arm. Like her husband, she seems to see
      none of the surrounding company, but gazes in front of her with a strange,
      half-apprehensive expression. They are both of them magnificently dressed.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Behind the Man and his Wife come the Man's Friends. The latter are
      uniformly like one another, with aristocratic faces, high, open foreheads,
      and candid eyes. They move with dignity&mdash;expanding their chests,
      setting down their feet with firmness and assurance, and gazing from side
      to side with faintly condescending smiles. They wear white buttonholes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Following them at a respectful distance come the Man's Enemies. These
      also bear a strong general resemblance to one another&mdash;their faces
      being vicious and cunning, their brows low and beetling, and their hands
      slender and apelike. They move as though ill at ease&mdash;jostling one
      another, hunching their shoulders, hiding behind one another, and throwing
      sharp, mean, envious glances about them. They wear yellow buttonholes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>In this manner the procession moves slowly across the salon, without a
      word being spoken by any one of its members. The sound of their footsteps,
      combined with the strains of the musicians and the acclamations of the
      guests, gives rise to a sort of confused, discordant din.</i>

    </p>
    <p>
      Where have they gone to?
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great dining-room, I suppose, where supper is to be served.

      Yes. Has not a lackey come to summon us?

      I think it is high time we were sent for. If supper be served much later
      than this, we shall all of us sleep badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I assure you I <i>always</i> sup early.
    </p>
    <p>
      A late supper lies so heavily on one's stomach!
    </p>
    <p>
      The music still goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and so do the dancers. Yet I am surprised that they have not tired of
      it.

    </p>
    <p>
      Did you see how many covers were laid for supper?
    </p>
    <p>
      No. I had barely time to begin counting them before the butler entered the
      room and I had to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely we have not been forgotten?
    </p>
    <p>
      My good madam, please remember that (in his own eyes, at least) the Man is
      a very great personage, and that we are personages of <i>small</i>
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter. My husband often asserts that it is <i>we</i> who do <i>the Man</i>
      honour by accepting his invitations&mdash;not <i>the Man</i> who does <i>us</i>
      honour by according them. We are rich ourselves, for that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if one should also take into account the reputation of his wife&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Has any one seen a footman, sent to summon us to supper? Perhaps he is
      looking for us in one of the other rooms?
    </p>
    <p>
      How rich the Man must be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet wealth may be acquired without dipping one's hands into other people's
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush! Only the Man's Enemies say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed? And do they not comprise among their number men of the highest
      honour? My husband is one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      How late it is getting!
    </p>
    <p>
      I think there must have been some misunderstanding here. I can scarcely
      suppose that we have <i>purposely</i> been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if you cannot suppose that, I must say that your knowledge of life
      and men is grossly deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am surprised. We ourselves are rich, but&mdash;&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas only your fancy. <i>No one</i> has called us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel it my bounden duty to remark that I cannot conceive how we ever
      came to permit ourselves to patronize a house which possesses such a
      dubious reputation. Of a surety we ought to pick and choose our
      acquaintances more carefully.

      and throws the strong face and chin of the Being into sharp relief.

      ACT IV&mdash;RUIN AND BEREAVEMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      [<i>The scene is a large, square room of poverty-stricken, dilapidated
      appearance, with walls, floor, and ceiling dark in colour, and the back
      wall broken only by two lofty, curtainless windows through which the outer
      night shows darkly. Between the windows is a door leading out into the
      garden. The general effect of the room gives the beholder the impression
      that, however brilliantly it were lighted, the great, dark expanses of
      window-pane would still absorb the major portion of the light. To the left
      is a second door, giving entry to other portions of the Man's mansion.
      Near this second door there stands a sofa, upholstered in coarse
      horsehair, while beneath one of the windows there can be seen the Man's
      working-table&mdash;a perfectly plain piece of furniture. Upon it are
      mingled in careless confusion a dimly burning candle, a shaded lamp, a
      faded sketch-plan, and three child's toys&mdash;namely, a small pasteboard
      helmet, a wooden horse without a tail, and a red-nosed clown doll, holding
      cymbals in its hands. To the right is an old bookcase&mdash;empty, and
      almost falling to pieces, but showing, by the lines left in the dust with
      which its shelves are covered, that the books which it formerly contained
      have not long been removed. The room contains a single chair.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>In one corner, darker than the rest of the scene, there stands the
      Being in Grey. The candle in his hand is now reduced to a stump, and even
      from this the wax is fast running down as it burns with a red, unsteady
      light and throws gleams of a ruddy hue over the stony face and chin of the
      Being.</i> [<i>Seated on the solitary chair which the room contains, and
      talking to herself, is discovered an old woman&mdash;the last remaining
      servant of the Man.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><b>The Old Woman.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So once again the Man has sunk to poverty! Once upon a time he had many
      valuable possessions&mdash;horses, carriages, even a motor-car; but now he
      has nothing at all. Of his many servants I am the only one left. True,
      this room and two others still contain an odd piece or two of furniture,
      but in the other fifteen apartments there is nothing whatever; they stand
      dark and empty, and day and night the rats scamper and squeak in them. <i>Some</i>
      people might be afraid of the rats, but I am not. Nothing matters much to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while now there has been a notice-board hanging on the
      entrance-gates, to say that the mansion is for sale; but no one seems to
      care to be a purchaser. The board has grown rusty with the rain, and the
      letters on it are fast being washed out, but no customer ever appears. <i>Who</i>
      would want to buy a house in such repair? Still, some day some one <i>might</i>
      do so, and then we shall be turned out of doors, I suppose, and have to
      seek another place in which to lay our heads. At first it will seem
      strange to us, but we shall soon get used to it. Sometimes my mistress
      weeps, and my master too, but <i>I</i> never weep. Nothing matters much to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you wondering what has become of all the Man's wealth? Nay, I do not
      know. Sometimes I too wonder, but I have lived a long life in service, and
      have seen more than one great fortune slip away into chinks and clefts,
      and vanish quietly. So it has been with my master and mistress. At first
      they had much, then little, then nothing at all. Once upon a time patrons
      and customers used to come and give my master commissions. Now they have
      ceased to come. That is all. One day I asked my mistress why things were
      so, and she replied: "What used to be fashionable is not so now. People no
      longer care for the styles in architecture which they used to affect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what has made the fashions change?" said I. She made no answer, but
      burst into tears. <i>I</i> shed no tears. Nothing matters much to me,
      nothing matters much to me. So long as they pay me my wages I shall stop
      with them, and as soon as they cease paying those wages I shall go and
      take service elsewhere. For many years I have done their cooking for them,
      but I should leave them at once, and go and cook for some one else, if my
      wages were to cease. In any case I shall soon have to give up working, for
      I am growing old, and my sight is not what it was. Some day, perhaps, I
      shall be dismissed&mdash;yes, told to go about my business and make room
      for some one else. Ah, well, what will it matter? I shall just go&mdash;that
      is all. Nothing matters much to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes people are surprised at me. "It must be lonely for you," they
      say, "in that kitchen&mdash;alone every evening while the wind howls in
      the chimney, and the rats scamper and squeak." I do not know. Perhaps it
      <i>is</i> lonely, only I never think of it. Why should I? My master and
      mistress sit alone, the same as I do, and look at one another, and listen
      to the wind; and I sit in my kitchen and listen to the wind also. Once
      upon a time young folks used to come and visit my master's little son; and
      then there would be such singing and laughter and scampering about the
      empty rooms to scare the rats! Yet no one ever came to see <i>me</i>. No,
      I sat alone as I am sitting now&mdash;alone, quite alone: and since I have
      no one to talk to I talk to myself. Nothing matters much to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days ago yet another misfortune came upon this house. The young
      master brushed his hair, and cocked his hat as young gentlemen will do,
      and went out for a walk. And some rascally villain picked up a stone, and
      threw it at him, and split the boy's head like a cocoa-nut. Well, he was
      lifted up, and brought home, and now lies upon his bed&mdash;though
      whether to live or to die the good God alone knows. My old master and
      mistress wept so bitterly over him! Then they took all the books out of
      that bookcase yonder, and piled them upon a cart, and sent them away to be
      sold: and with the money they have hired a nurse, and bought medicines and
      grapes for the boy. But he will not touch the grapes, nor look at them,
      and they lie unheeded on a plate by his bedside.

      with a stone, and now lies at death's door?

      Very well, I will attend the young gentleman. Oh dear, oh dear! I am for
      ever being sent for, for ever being sent for&mdash;day and night alike!
      This time it is night, and though the street lamps have long ago been put

      Already one doctor has been to attend the boy, without doing him any good,
      and now here comes another one&mdash;to do him about as little, I reckon.
      Well, what of that? The boy will die, and we shall go on living without
      him&mdash;that is all. I shall go on sitting in my kitchen as before,
      without a soul to keep me company, and think; and one room the more will
      be left empty for the rats to scamper and squeak in. Well, <i>let</i> them
      scamper, and <i>let</i> them squeak: it is all one to me.

      Do you want to know why that ruffian flung the stone at the young master's
      head? Nay, I do not know. How should I know why men want to kill one
      another? All I know is that a man threw a stone, and then hid himself in a
      dark corner, and that a boy was struck by that stone, and now lies
      a-dying. They say that the young master was good and kind to poor people.
      Maybe. I do not know. It is all one to me. Kind or cruel, old or young,
      alive or dead&mdash;folk are all one to me. So long as I am paid my wages
      I shall stop where I am; and when those wages cease I shall move elsewhere
      and cook for some one else, or, maybe, give up working altogether, for I
      am growing old, and sometimes mistake salt for sugar. Or perhaps I shall
      be discharged, and told to go about my business, so that they may get
      another cook in my place. Well, what of that? I shall just go&mdash;that
      is all. Every place is the same to me&mdash;here, there, or anywhere;
      every place is the same to me.

      pray Thee, forgive me these things. Punish me if Thou wilt&mdash;punish me
      howsoever Thou pleasest: only spare us the life of our son. Yea, spare
      him, I beseech Thee. I do not ask this of Thy mercy, nor of Thy pity, but
      of Thy <i>justice</i>: for Thou art old in years, as even am I, and
      wouldst the better comprehend me for that. Evil men have tried to kill our
      son&mdash;cruel, pitiless men who lurked in dark places and cast stones at
      him. Yea, they lurked in dark places, and cast stones at him, the cowardly
      villains! Yet suffer them not to have achieved their evil purpose, seeing
      that they are men who do offend Thee with their misdeeds, and pollute Thy
      earth with their abominations. Staunch Thou, rather, the blood of our
      beloved son, and preserve to us his life. When Thou didst take away from
      me my riches, did I beseech and importune Thee to give me back my
      possessions, my friends, my fame, my talents? Did I, O God? No, never did
      I. I asked not even that my talents should be restored to me; and Thou
      Thyself knowest that a man's talents are more to him than life itself.
      Perchance, thought I, these things must be; so I bore them&mdash;bore them
      ever without complaining. Yet now I beseech Thee&mdash;here on my knees,
      and kissing the very dust of earth before Thee&mdash;that Thou wilt
      restore to us our little son. Yea, I kiss the very earth in token of my
      supplication.

      Ah, now you are joking, just as you used to do. But lie down here, my
      darling, and take some sleep, while I go and sit by our boy. You may rest
      easy, for I shall not leave him, and when he wakes I will call you.&mdash;You
      will not mind kissing an old wrinkled hand, will you?

    </p>
    <p>
      Wrinkles? What wrinkles? I see only a beautiful, dear, kind, clever face&mdash;beyond
      that, nothing. You will not be angry with me for chiding you thus? Now go
      to our boy, and watch over him; spreading around his bed the calm halo of
      your love and tenderness. And if he should be restless in his sleep, sing
      to him a little lullaby, as you were wont to do, and place the grapes near
      his bedside, so that he may be able to reach them with his hand when he
      awakes.

      head at the end which is nearest to the corner occupied by the motionless
      figure of the Being in Grey: so near, indeed, that the hand of the Being
      seems almost to be resting upon the Man's grey, dishevelled locks. In a

    </p>
    <p>
      Thus in sound and happy slumber sleeps the Man&mdash;buoyed up with fond,
      delusive hopes. His breathing is as calm as that of a little child, and
      his aged heart beats evenly and quietly as he rests. He knows not that
      within a few seconds his son will have passed away for ever into the
      Infinite. Yet even as the Man lies there the shadowy mists of sleep are
      presenting to his vision a dream of happiness which shall never be. He
      dreams that he is with his son, and that together they are gliding in a
      fair white boat down a broad and peaceful river. It seems to him that it
      is a beautiful day in summer, and that he is gazing upon pure blue sky and
      water clear as crystal. He can hear the rustling of the reeds as they part
      before the boat, and in his heart he is joyous and hopeful. For all his
      senses are deceiving the Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet suddenly he grows uneasy. Some strange fancy has pierced the mists of
      sleep and seared his soul. "Why have thy golden locks been shorn, my boy?
      Why have they done that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My head was hurting me, Papa. That is why they have shorn my locks." And
      once again, in his fond delusion, the Man feels happy as he gazes at the
      blue sky and listens to the rustling of the reeds as they part before the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; he knows not that at this moment his son is dying. He knows not that
      his beloved child is calling to him with a last voiceless cry of the soul
      as, in the throes of delirium, the boy's childish instinct turns once more
      to its belief in the superior strength of his elders. "Papa, Papa! I am
      dying! Save me, Papa!" No; the Man sleeps on, in sound and happy slumber,
      while secret, fleeting dreams continue to present to his vision a dream of
      happiness which shall never be.

      fling back in thy face, thou Fate, thou Demon! Cursed be thou&mdash;aye,

      last. For, in truth, what more canst thou do unto me? Strike me, if thou
      wilt&mdash;aye, strike me to the ground: I will yet laugh aloud in thy
      face, and cry, "My curse be upon thee, my curse be upon thee!" Or fill my

      breath gasp into thy obscene ears, "My curse be upon thee, my curse be

      ACT V&mdash;THE DEATH OF THE MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      [<i>When the curtain rises the stage is discovered wrapped in a vague,
      dim, flickering light&mdash;the sort of light which makes it difficult to
      distinguish objects at the first glance. Gradually, however, as the eye
      grows accustomed to the gloom, the following picture begins to stand out
      from the obscurity.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>The scene is a large, low hall or cellar, to which there are neither
      doors nor windows, but which is entered by a ladder leading down from a
      trapdoor in the ceiling. The walls are bare of ornamentation, and so
      thickly encrusted with dirt that almost they seem to be covered with
      leather made out of the hide of some gigantic wild beast. Along the back
      wall runs a rudely constructed drinking-bar, containing rows of bottles
      filled with variously-coloured liquids; and in front of this bar the
      proprietor of the den is seated on a low stool, with his hands clasped
      over his stomach. His face is pale, save for a pair of brilliantly red
      cheeks, and his head bald, while his neck and chin are covered with a
      large tawny beard. His whole expression denotes absolute lethargy and
      indifference, and he retains this attitude unchanged throughout the entire
      Act&mdash;never at any time making the least modification in his posture.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>At a number of small tables persons of both sexes are seated drinking&mdash;the
      apparent number of these individuals being increased by the fantastic
      shadows which dart hither and thither over the walls and ceiling of the
      room. All have faces both horrible and repulsive, but in such infinite
      variety of ugliness that they resemble, rather, an assortment of hideous
      masks. Likewise, the majority of them have one or more features either
      grotesquely exaggerated or wholly absent, such, for instance, as a
      gigantic nose or no nose at all, eyes wildly protruding or shrunk to
      imperceptible slits, a throat horribly goitred or a chin receding to the
      point of deformity. Also, most of them have coarse, matted hair which
      covers the greater portion of their faces. Yet, despite this bizarre
      variety of feature, there is a marked similarity in the general appearance
      of these creatures&mdash;a similarity which finds its most distinctive
      characteristic in the greenish, corpselike hue with which their faces are
      overlaid, no matter whether the face be rudely jocular or convulsed with
      semi-maniacal fear and horror. As for the bodies of the drunkards, they
      are clad in the most miserable of rags, of a uniformly dull, monotonous
      colour, and disclosing here a livid, bony hand or knee, and there a
      deformed or concave chest. Indeed, some of the wretches are almost naked,
      whilst the Women are indistinguishable from the men, save for the fact
      that they are, if anything, the more uncouth. Men and women alike have
      tremulous hands and heads, and whenever a drunkard rises to walk about, he
      or she moves as though treading upon an exceedingly slippery, uneven, or
      unstable surface. Finally, the same timbre of voice&mdash;a sort of harsh
      and grating croak&mdash;is common to all, and they mouth their words as
      haltingly as they walk, with lips which seem frozen.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>At a table a little apart from the rest there sits the Man. His white,
      dishevelled head is bowed upon his arms, and he maintains this attitude
      unchanged until the moment, towards the close of the Act, when he rises
      and speaks for the last time. Like the drunkards, he is very poorly clad.</i>

      [<i>In another corner of the room there stands the motionless figure of
      the Being in Grey. In the Beings hand a fast-expiring candle (its flame
      now grown thin and blue) is flickering heavily, as at one moment it droops
      downwards over the edge of the candlestick, and at another darts upwards
      into a fine point as it casts gleams of a lurid, deathlike hue over the
      statuesque face and chin of the Being.</i>]

      I am dying, I am dying! O my God! Who will carry me to the grave, or lay
      me in it? My corpse will be left to cumber the streets like a dog's, to be
      trodden upon by passers-by, to be ridden over and crushed! O my God, my

      Good evening to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      And to you! What a glorious night it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are all here, are we not? How are <i>you?</i>

      I have caught a little cold, I think.

      This time we shall not have very long to wait. Death and the Man have
      nearly met.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the candle! See its thin, blue, ragged flame! It has almost no wax now&mdash;only
      wick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; but it seems reluctant to go out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well? Are not <i>all</i> candles reluctant to go out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, come! No quarrelling, no quarrelling! Whether the candle chooses to
      go out or not, the Man's time is fast ebbing away.

    <p>
      Do you remember his motor-car? Once it nearly ran me down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his mansion, too, with the sixteen rooms in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. I was in them a short while ago. The rats nearly devoured me, and the
      draughts nearly blew me away, for some one had stolen the window-frames
      from their sockets, and the wind was tearing through the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you had a snooze on the very bed on which his Wife died, did you not?
      Oh, you sentimental old thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      I did. But I must confess that some queer thoughts passed through my mind
      as I wandered through those rooms. There used to be such a charming
      nursery in the mansion, and I felt hurt to see that its windows were all
      shattered, and that the wind was blowing the dust in clouds over the
      floor. And there used to be such a lovely little cradle in the room! Now
      the rats are making <i>their</i> nests in that nursery, and rocking <i>their</i>
      children to sleep in that cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh the dear little naked rat-children!

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And on a table in the study, I saw some broken toys&mdash;a little horse
      without a tail, a pasteboard helmet, and a red-nosed clown doll. I played
      with them each in turn, and tried on the helmet. It would have suited me
      well enough if it had only been a trifle less mouldy and covered with
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      And surely you paid a visit to the grand <i>salon</i> where the ball was
      given that night? What a gay scene it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I went in there too. But judge of my surprise when I found it in
      darkness, with the windows broken, and the wind whistling round the
      cornices!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! That would serve as music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, of course. And the walls were all lined with guests&mdash;with guests
      sitting there in the darkness! You should have seen how queer they looked!
    </p>
    <p>
      We can imagine it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you should have heard them ejaculating with their old wheedling lips,
      "How rich it all is! How sumptuous!"

    <p>
      Oh, you are joking!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I am only joking. You know my playful disposition.

      How "rich" indeed, how "sumptuous," everything must have looked when you
      went in!

      Ah! he is near his death now.

      Do you remember how the dancers surrounded you, and how tenderly, how
      bewitchingly, the music played? It played like this.

      First of all we must call the musicians. One cannot have a proper ball
      without music.

      The musicians?

      Yes, certainly. Do you not remember them?

      down the ladder the same three musicians who played at the Man's ball. The

      soft and low, as in a dream.</i>]

      first phrase of the tune they whirl themselves round; to the second they
      converge and retire; to the third and fourth they whirl themselves round
